This repository is the main part of the control algorithm of a Zybo powered self driving car.

It is composed of a lane detection and following algorithm, road signs image recognition and RFID card reading. With all this data the car can steer itself so it can stay inside two lines, identify and perform specific actions for road signs as well as for RFID cards.

This part of the project consists mostly of OpenCV, for the whole project visit:
